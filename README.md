#### Very experimental (plus I'm a bit of a Rust noob, please be gentle!)

A thought experiment on the Callbag specification coined by [Andr√© Staltz](https://github.com/staltz). Very rough around the edges right now, but hella fun to hack on.

Run tests with `cargo test -- --nocapture` to see output.
